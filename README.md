My program decides what food the user should eat based on their hunger level,available time,and whether they want healthy food.
An interesting example is the program first checks if the food is hot or cold and then asks an additional question about protein choice
Create a python decision making program that asks multiple questions and uses if elif else statements to give a food recommendation(Homework 1)
(homework 2)In Python, the for loop is often better than a while loop because it acts as a self-managing machine. When generating something structured like a multiplication table, you aren't waiting for a random event to happen; you are iterating through a known range of numbers.When I first tried writing a loop to go from 1 to 10, the output stopped at 9.To fix it, I had to adjust the "stop" parameter to 11.
